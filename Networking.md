# Networking Fundamentals Review ( I Skipped and Tested out so not much in way of notes )

[Quiz Review]

  - The following association modes are used by NTP servers to associate with each other: client/server, symmetric active/passive, and broadcast.

- The nslookup tool is a command-line utility used for querying DNS to obtain domain name to IP address mapping.
- The seven layers of the OSI model are physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
- DHCP operations fall into four phases: server discovery, IP lease offer, IP lease request, and IP lease acknowledgement
- The Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronizes the time of day among a set of distributed time servers and clients. This allows the correlatation of events when you receive system logs and other time-specific events from multiple network devices. Find more information about it in the module section with the same name.
- DHCP is the acronym for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Find more information about it in the module section with the same name.
- Classes A, B, and C each have a range of IP addresses reserved for internal use, which means that they cannot be used on the public Internet. This internal use designation is known as Private IP addresses. Class A range is 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.
- The types of NAT include static address translation (static NAT), dynamic address translation (dynamic NAT), and overloading. 
### Technically not correct (Overloading source from IOS keyword "overload" in a nat command, the technical representation of this keywork is to enable port address translation function aka PAT.
- The three functional planes of a network are the management plane, the control plane, and the data plane, with each providing different functionality.
- NTP is designed to synchronize the time on a network of devices.
- The most common types of records stored in a DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6 addresses), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME).
- The switch operates in either the cut-through switching mode or the store-and-forward switching mode.
