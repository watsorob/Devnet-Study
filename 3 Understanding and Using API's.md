 - Remote procedure calls are typically synchronous, but not always. Some remote procedure calls are asynchronous. There is nothing in the transport protocol that prevents them from being asynchronous
 - The 3xx group of errors refers to situations in which a resource has been moved. The client may be automatically forwarded to the new address, or the user must make a second request to the new URL.
 -  Asynchronous APIs will respond with no data immediately after the request to signify that the request has been received by the server. Synchronous APIs will also respond to requests immediately, but with the requested data.
 -  It is best practice to use the POST HTTP verb for creating an object or resource, but it's not mandatory. There aren't any standards when it comes to the HTTP verb pairing with CRUD operations.
 -  Authentication is verifying the user's identity. Basic authentication, bearer authentication, and API key are authentication mechanisms. OAuth is an authorization mechanism.
 -  APIs are popular right now for many reasons. The industry is growing at a very fast rate and therefore, the demand for integrations has grown. As a result, APIs are now being designed into the product, so they are thoroughly tested and reliable. The creation of REST APIs is also a big factor of the popularity. REST APIs are HTTP-based, so they are lightweight and can be used in almost all types of applications. Lastly, easier and simplified coding languages, such as Python, have made it possible for non-software engineers to build applications and consume these APIs.
 -  APIs can be consumed programmatically by applications or manually by humans. REST APIs are HTTP-based, but APIs in general are not restricted to any particular protocol. APIs have existed for decades, but the implementation of REST APIs have made them very popular.
 -  The correct order and syntax of a URI is scheme:[//authority][/path][?query]. The scheme can be http or https. The authority is the host:port. The path is the location of the resource, data, or object. Lastly, the query can contain optional parameters that provide additional details for scope or filters, or to clarify a request.
 -  Synchronous APIs respond to requests immediately with the requested data. Asynchronous APIs respond immediately after the request to signify that the request was received, but the response will not include any data.
 -  Authentication is not mandatory for APIs. There are a lot of APIs that return non-critical data that do not require authentication. For example, an API that retrieves the status of the system might not require authentication.
 -  Bad request is a client error and therefore falls under the 4xx HTTP status code category. A bad request is specifically mapped to HTTP status code 400, which means that the request will not be processed due to an error with the request.
 -  There are four elements of a SOAP Message: envelope, header, body, and fault.
