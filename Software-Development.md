# Section review; Software dev and design
  -	The benefits of version control are accountability and visibility, the ability to work in isolation, safety, remote productivity, and that it enables collaboration.
  -	The benefits of delivering as fast as possible are: enabling customers to provide feedback, enabling developers to amplify learning, giving customers the features they need now, not giving customers an opportunity to change their mind, making everyone make decisions faster, and producing less waste.
  -	Waterfall is one full SDLC. In Agile, each sprint is a quick iteration of the SDLC. Agile still follows the SDLC, but completes a life cycle quickly and with many iterations.
  - Change-based code review is also known as tool-assisted code review and typically uses peer code review tools.
  - The principle of test-driven development is that developers should write testing code before writing application code.
  - Common types of code reviews include: formal code review, over-the-shoulder code review, change-based code review, and email pass-around.
  - The three main categories of the original design patterns are creational, structural, and behavioral.
  - Product owners are responsible for the backlog. They may receive assistance from other members of the software development team, such as an architect, but ultimately the product owner is responsible for the backlog.
  - There are three types of version control systems: local version control systems, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems.
  - There are eight wastes in lean software development: partially done work, extra processes, extra features, task switching, waiting, motion, defects, and management activities
  - XML attributes allow embeded information within tags to convey additional information.
  - A module is essentially a library and cannot be instantiated. A class is instance-based, so must be instantiated.
  - The benefits of version control are accountability and visibility, the ability to work in isolation, safety, remote productivity, and that it enables collaboration.
