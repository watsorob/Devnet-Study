# Understanding and Using API's

API Stands for Application Programming Interface

Use Cases
- Automation Tasks
- Data Integration
- Functionality

Design Styling
API's can be delivered either Synchronously or Asynchronously (Design Style Types)

Architectural Styles
RPC, SOAP, REST are the three most popular

Lets get some Rest now ......

Note six principles of REST are
1 Client-Server
2 Stateless
3 Cache
4 Uniform Interface
5 Layered System
6 Code-On-Demand (Optional)

REST API requests are made of 4 major components
1 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
2 HTTP Method
3 Header
4 Body

(QUIZ Study Aid)
 - Remote procedure calls are typically synchronous, but not always. Some remote procedure calls are asynchronous. There is nothing in the transport protocol that prevents them from being asynchronous
