Module Overview

- There are 4 load balancer algorithms: Persistent sessions, round robin, Least connections, and IP Hash. Reverse proxy is not a load balancer algorithm.

- A stored XSS attack involves data stored in your database and a reflected XSS attack is passed along in a URL.

- A hybrid cloud is a system where if the private cloud canâ€™t handle an increase in traffic, it uses resources from a public cloud.

- Pipelines are the root of CI/CD, providing a way to automate testing and deployment.

- CI/CD pipelines can encompass multiple parts of development; all of these roles can be part of a pipeline in terms of both development and approval.

- Data at rest is data that you have stored either in your database or in other locations.

- A reverse proxy works to make sure responses look like they all come from the same server.

- If an attacker gets access to your database, you don't want the data to be usable.

- Designing the application takes place before CI/CD is initiated.

- The advantages of bare metal infrastructure are direct interaction with the hardware, better performance, and completely isolated workloads.

- The benefits of continuous integration and continuous deployment are integration with agile methodologies, shorter mean time to resolution (MTTR), automated deployment, less disruptive feature releases, improved quality, and improved time to market

- A VPN is a Virtual Private Network, isolating and encrypting communications.
