Infrastructure automation can deliver many benefits, which can be summarized as:

- Speed
- Repeatability
- The ability to work at scale, with reduced risk
Automation is a key component of functional software-defined infrastructure and distributed and dynamic applications.

  - GitOps treats infrastructure as code and uses version control systems like Git.

  - Canary deployments are a gradual method of moving users to a new release deployment.

  -  "Self-service" refers to application catalogs and other automated tools and methods whereby end-users, developers, and other authorized parties can requisition and take delivery of IT resources such as preconfigured developer platforms, big data analytics clusters, and other deliverables, without human intervention.

  -  VIRL uses OpenVPN to connect to an external Network.

  - The learn command in pyATS extracts a full network configuration and stores the output in JSON.

  -  the standard command to launch a Python virtual environment in Linux "python3 -m venv myproject"

  - Blue-green deployments use two identical production environments, and new releases are deployed on one while maintaining the original on the other.
  - characteristics of stateless apps
    - They tend to persist state in a database, away from application servers and other components.
    - They can be freely scaled across available capacity, without disrupting ongoing customer connections.


  - Automation provides speed, repeatability, and the ability to work at scale with reduced risk.

  - An SLI is a real-world benchmark metric used to determine SLOs.

  - Chef DSL is based on Ruby.

  - Chef and Puppet both require a standard time-synchronization utility to run on servers and agent hosts. (NTP)
